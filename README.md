## Summary of Findings

- **Heapsort**: The time complexity of Heapsort is `O(n log n)` in the worst, average, and best cases. It is an in-place sorting algorithm with `O(1)` space complexity. While it has consistent performance, it may not perform as efficiently as other algorithms like Quicksort in practice.

- **Priority Queue**: The priority queue implemented using a max-heap allows for efficient access to the highest priority task. All core operations (insert, extract, increase_key) are performed in `O(log n)` time.

- **Comparison**: 
  - **Heapsort vs. Quicksort**: While both algorithms have an average-case time complexity of `O(n log n)`, Quicksort can be faster in practice due to better cache performance, although it has a worst-case time complexity of `O(n^2)` under poor pivot selection.
  - **Heapsort vs. Merge Sort**: Merge Sort also has `O(n log n)` time complexity but requires additional space, unlike Heapsort, which operates in-place with `O(1)` space complexity.
# Heap Data Structures: Implementation, Analysis, and Applications
This repository contains the implementation of heap data structures, including Heapsort and a priority queue, using Python. The project focuses on implementing these algorithms, analyzing their time and space complexities, and comparing them with other sorting algorithms. The priority queue implementation is used for task scheduling based on priority.
